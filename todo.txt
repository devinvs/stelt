- Type Inference
    + Is this even necessary? idk.
    + Maybe for numeric types (i8, u8, etc)
- Define type storage specification
    + Closures?
- Function annotations? (pure, impure)
- Low Level Memory operations?

- memory model ideas
    + Check out Carp
    + Check out rust
    + essentially implement the borrow checker...
    + every variable declared in a lexical scope is dropped at the end of
        the scope.
        - Basically functions, let statements, and match cases
    + Everything is pass by reference unless used in a constructor.
        + constructors always take ownership

- start with OSGC
- ranges/ errors with type checker
- trait resolution...

- unify types instead of terms?
